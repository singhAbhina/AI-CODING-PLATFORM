# Deployment Fixes for Authentication Issues

## Problem Summary
Your deployed application was experiencing "token not present" errors when users tried to sign up, while admin login was working. This was caused by several deployment-related issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **CORS Configuration**
- **Problem**: CORS was only allowing one specific origin
- **Fix**: Updated CORS to handle multiple origins and added proper headers
- **File**: `backend/src/index.js`

### 2. **Cookie Settings**
- **Problem**: Cookie settings were too strict for cross-origin requests
- **Fix**: Made cookie settings environment-aware and more flexible
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/userAuthent.js`

### 3. **Token Handling**
- **Problem**: Frontend was only trying to read from cookies, backend was setting httpOnly cookies
- **Fix**: Added dual token handling (cookies + response body) and localStorage fallback
- **Files**: `backend/src/controllers/userAuthent.js`, `frontend/src/authSlice.js`

### 4. **Middleware Authentication**
- **Problem**: Middleware only checked cookies, not Authorization headers
- **Fix**: Updated middleware to check both cookies and Authorization headers
- **File**: `backend/src/middleware/userMiddleware.js`

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Poor error messages and handling
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error display
- **Files**: Multiple files updated

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1. **Set Environment Variables** in Render dashboard:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   FRONTEND_URL=https://frontend-64pi.onrender.com
   JWT_KEY=your_secure_jwt_secret
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
   PORT=3000
   ```

2. **Build Command**: `npm install`
3. **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Frontend Deployment (Render)

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Publish Directory**: `dist`
3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://proj-backend-un8b.onrender.com
   ```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Test Backend Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://proj-backend-un8b.onrender.com/user/health
   ```

2. **Test User Registration**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://proj-backend-un8b.onrender.com/user/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"firstName":"Test","emailId":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

3. **Use the Test Script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-auth.js
   ```

## How It Works Now

1. **User Registration**: 
   - User fills signup form
   - Frontend sends POST to `/user/register`
   - Backend creates user, sets httpOnly cookie, AND sends token in response
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage as backup

2. **User Login**:
   - User fills login form
   - Frontend sends POST to `/user/login`
   - Backend verifies credentials, sets httpOnly cookie, AND sends token in response
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage as backup

3. **Authentication**:
   - Frontend sends token in Authorization header
   - Backend checks both cookies and Authorization header
   - If either is valid, user is authenticated

## Troubleshooting

### If users still can't sign up:

1. **Check Browser Console** for CORS errors
2. **Verify Backend URL** in frontend axiosClient.js
3. **Check Environment Variables** in Render dashboard
4. **Test Backend Endpoints** using the test script
5. **Check Render Logs** for backend errors

### Common Issues:

- **CORS Error**: Ensure FRONTEND_URL is set correctly in backend
- **Database Connection**: Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
- **JWT Key**: Ensure JWT_KEY is set and secure
- **Redis Connection**: Verify REDIS_URL is correct

## Security Notes

- JWT tokens expire in 1 hour
- Tokens are stored in both httpOnly cookies and localStorage
- httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- CORS is properly configured for production
- All sensitive routes require authentication

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated backend
2. Deploy the updated frontend
3. Test user registration and login
4. Monitor Render logs for any errors
5. Test admin functionality to ensure it still works
